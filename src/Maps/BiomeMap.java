	 * For each biome, determine the type based on the local conditions and vary the growth based on location and type 
	 * Generate names and stuff for the biomes from simple algorithms and some XML of random names
	 * Add noise to the edges, idk why I'm doing this here but it's mainly about the polygon class and it's best to keep the polygons simpler until now  
	 * Make a class that renders this stuff out for me to test it with
